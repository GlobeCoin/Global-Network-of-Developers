This project is intended as a global currency where multinational developers and investors alike develop and code together on a unprecedented scale. A democracy whereas the investor (the public) is in control of the development cycle of this project by either contribution on development, or vote developers on/off the team. No one person shall have total control or monopolize this currency. Anyone and everyone is the project manager to protect against ICO corruption and ICO scams.
